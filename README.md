## Overview

### What is TOP*SIX*DASHBOARD?

Essentially, the **TOP**SIX**DASHBOARD** is a data-rich dashboard allowing you to compare the statistics of six of the biggest teams in English football.

### What does it do?

This dashboard enables you to dive into the stats of your favourite Premier League teams and compare them with other title contenders over the years. You can now visualise the journey of your favourite teams in this data rich dashboard analysing their end of season results and comparing them with the remaining title rivals.

### How does it work?

**TOP**SIX**DASHBOARD** uses a collection of tools to present data in intuitive visualisations. MongoDB is used to store the data, whilst Flask, a Python microframework, is used to retrieve data from MongoDB and present this on the browser. JavaScript libraries such as D3.js, DC.js and Crossfilter.js is used to achieve beautiful data visualisation techniques.

## Technologies Implemented

- HTML5
	> As with every website or web based app, the use of Hypertext Markup Language is paramount. HTML5 has been used as the markup for this project as this would enable use of many of the new semantics to keep the structure of this project clear and in keeping with the latest industry standards.
- CSS
	> As with markup, Cascading Style Sheets are essential when controlling the layout of the website. Custom CSS was used in this project in conjunction with Bootstrap 4 to style **TOP**SIX**DASHBOARD** enhancing user interaction and delivering exceptional user experience.
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction)
	> The Bootstrap framework was used for this project to utilise various components such as Bootstrap's Navbar, Grid, Variables and many other utilities.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)
    > I used **SASS** as my chosen CSS preprocessor. This is a great way to import custom styles and override the original Bootstrap library. I also have the added benefit of using variables and mixins along with other cool tricks. 
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
	> Node Package Manager was used to install Bootstrap 4 on this project. This approach is ideal as it allows greater flexibility when overriding Bootstrap's original Sass files.
- JavaScript
	> Custom JavaScript was used on this project as well as other JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, dc.js, d3.js and crossfilter.js. Custom JavaScript was used primarily for the mobile toggle menu button and responsive design choices.
- [DC.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)
	> Dc.js is a JavaScript library used to make interactive dashboards in JavaScript. By clicking and selecting different events in graphs, you can filter the entire dashboard to drill into a particular event.
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
	> D3.js is a JavaScript library which can be used to create rich data visualizations. D3 takes data which you provide, usually through an external file, and helps bring that data to life using HTML, CSS, and SVG.
- [Crossfilter.js](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/)
	> Crossfilter.js is a JavaScript plugin used to slice and dice JavaScript arrays. This allows Dc.js to easily manipulate the data table that the graphs use, so they can refresh with the filtered data.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
	> Python is the Back-end programming language used for this project, primarily for the functionalities of Flask and its open library of essential packages. 
- Flask
	> Flask, a Python microframework is used for this project to route the app to various pages and retrieve data stored on MongoDB, returning it back to the browser.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
	> The Premier League data used for this project is being stored on MongoDB.

## Contributing

The **TOP**SIX**DASHBOARD** is a personal project created as part of my Full Stack Web Development course for [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net/). With that being said, it would be amazing to see the community getting involved by making or suggesting some really interesting changes to this dashboard.


**Things to consider:**
```
This dashboard relies on many tools and technologies for it to function properly. A large proportion of these have been configured in such a way that you would not be required to make any additional changes to the files for these to work. However, there are some aspects you will need to be taken into consideration if you choose to make changes to the dashboard.
```

**Prerequisites:**
```
Python 2.7.14
MongoDB 3.6.2
```

**Forking the repo:**

- Firstly, you will need to fork the repository. To do this, you will need to click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of this page
- You will now need a copy of these files on your computer to make changes. To do this, you will need to clone or download the repo you forked in the previous step onto your local computer.
	1. Click on the green **Clone or download** button
	2. Under **Clone with HTTPS**, copy the clone URL for the repository
	3. Open your Git terminal
	4. Type ```git clone``` followed by the URL copied in the second step. This should look something like the following:
	```console
	$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/premierleague.git
	```
	5. Lastly, you will need to hit Enter on your keyboard to request your clone.
<br />
And weâ€™re done! Well almost.
