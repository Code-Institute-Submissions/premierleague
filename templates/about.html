                            I am a north London based Computer Science / Information Technology graduate.
                            After graduating from the University of Hertfordshire, I was fortunate for having
                            the experience of developing two main company websites for an exciting IT solutions
                            company, Joskos Solutions, as a Marketing Executive Assistant. Not only strengthening
                            my skillset in web development, this role also developed my knowledge within digital
                            marketing and graphic design outside my comfort zone. Alongside this I also worked as
                            a Technician for Dixons Carphone for over three years, where my passion for the
                            ever-growing technology soared. I also embarked on a short project for 360GSP, an IT
                            training and recruitment company, as a Designer / Developer which solidified my skills
                            using the latest industry standards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to the nature of the web development industry which is continuously growing at an
                            exponential rate, I wanted to ensure I have the relevant skills and knowledge to tackle
                            real world scenarios within the industry. This is where Code Institute comes in. I am
                            currently studying for a Diploma in Software Development through Code Institute in a
                            course which is aligned and accredited by the Edinburgh Napier University. Upon completion,
                            I will fulfil my goals of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer which will enable me to
                            integrate both Front End and Back End systems seamlessly.
